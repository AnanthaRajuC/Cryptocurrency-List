### <a href="https://github.com/AnanthaRajuC/Cryptocurrency-List/blob/master/Blockchain%20Explorers.md" target="_blank" >Blockchain Explorers</a>

A Blockchain Explorer is a website that lets you do the following kinds of things:

* See the blocks that have just been added to the chain, when theyâ€™ve been mined, etc.
* Look up a previously mined block to see what transaction are included in it.
* Look up a transaction, to see what amounts were sent, and between what addresses.
* Look up a wallet address, to see what the balance is, and the history of transactions to and from that address.
* And generally explore your way around the blockchain.

### <a href="https://github.com/AnanthaRajuC/Cryptocurrency-List/blob/master/Cryptocurrency%20Exchanges.md" target="_blank" >Cryptocurrency Exchanges</a>

Cryptocurrency exchanges or digital currency exchanges (DCE) are businesses that allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies or digital currencies for other assets, such as conventional fiat money, or different digital currencies. They can be market makers that typically take the bid/ask spreads as transaction commissions for their services or simply charge fees as a matching platform.
